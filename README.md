# PCOS-prediction
Implemented interpretable models for a binary classification problem using health data. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes information like age, gender, work type, location, BMI, and the target variableâ€”predicting stroke occurrence. Utilized Flask, scikit-learn, and HTML for model deployment.
